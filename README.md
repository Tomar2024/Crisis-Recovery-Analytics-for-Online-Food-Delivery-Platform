Project Description
This project analyzes the business impact of a crisis on a food delivery platform using Power BI. The objective was to assess how the crisis affected demand, operations, customer experience, revenue, and loyalty by comparing pre-crisis and crisis periods. The dashboard converts raw transactional and review data into actionable insights for decision-making.
Business Questions

Which cities and restaurants experienced the highest decline in demand?
Did delivery performance and cancellation rates worsen during the crisis?
How did customer ratings and sentiment change over time
What was the financial impact of the crisis beyond topline revenue?
Did the crisis lead to loyalty erosion and high-value customer churn?
