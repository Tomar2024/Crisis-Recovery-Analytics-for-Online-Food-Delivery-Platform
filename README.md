1.    Project Description
This project analyzes the business impact of a crisis on a food delivery platform using Power BI. The objective was to assess how the crisis affected demand, operations, customer experience, revenue, and loyalty by comparing pre-crisis and crisis periods. The dashboard converts raw transactional and review data into actionable insights for decision-making.

2.    Business Questions
How did order volume and revenue change during the crisis compared to pre-crisis?
Which cities and restaurants experienced the highest decline in demand?
Did delivery performance and cancellation rates worsen during the crisis?
How did customer ratings and sentiment change over time
What was the financial impact of the crisis beyond topline revenue?
Did the crisis lead to loyalty erosion and high-value customer churn?

3.    Key Insights
Orders and revenue declined significantly during the crisis, with certain cities and high-volume restaurants disproportionately impacted.
Delivery delays and higher cancellations aligned with sharp drops in customer ratings.
Month-wise rating analysis revealed specific periods of severe customer dissatisfaction.
Sentiment analysis highlighted recurring negative feedback themes driving rating declines.
High-frequency and high-value customers showed early signs of churn, indicating long-term retention risk.

6.   Features/Highlights
QickBite Express faced a major business disruption due to food safety incidents and delivery outages, which led to customer churn, order volume decline, falling customer satisfaction, restaurant partner attrition, and increased acquisition costs.
Management needs data-driven insights to understand what went wrong, who was most impacted, and how to recover customers, rebuild trust, and stabilize operations efficiently.

The goal of this dashboard is to support crisis recovery decision-making by:

Identifying recoverable vs high-risk customer segments
Tracking order behavior changes across pre-crisis, crisis, and recovery phases
Evaluating delivery performance and operational gaps
Highlighting high-impact campaigns and restaurant partnerships
Monitoring customer feedback and sentiment trends

Ultimately, the dashboard helps leadership prioritize recovery investments and measure turnaround progress.

Customer Segmentation View
Shows active, churned, and at-risk users by demographics and order frequency to identify recovery targets.

Order Trend Analysis
Line and bar visuals comparing daily/monthly orders across pre-crisis, crisis, and recovery periods.

Delivery Performance Metrics
KPIs for average delivery time, SLA compliance, cancellations, and delays to pinpoint operational issues.

Campaign Effectiveness Dashboard
Compares order uplift, retention, and CAC before and after recovery campaigns.

Restaurant Partner Analysis
Identifies high-value and high-retention restaurants versus partners likely to churn.

Ratings & Sentiment Overview
Tracks customer ratings and review sentiment to monitor trust rebuilding in near real-time.

Recoverable customers are primarily medium-frequency users affected by delivery delays rather than trust issues.

Order volume decline aligns closely with delivery outages, confirming operations as a key churn driver.

Late deliveries and cancellations significantly impacted ratings during the crisis phase.

Targeted trust-rebuilding campaigns perform better than blanket discounts.

A small group of restaurant partners contributes disproportionately to long-term retention.

Improving delivery SLA and food safety visibility has the highest impact on customer satisfaction recovery.

These insights allow QuickBite to optimize recovery spend, retain valuable users, and rebuild brand trust faster.
